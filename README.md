# IIS Library

Useful helpers for WordPress theme development

## Install

Add repo to composer repositories and require:

```
composer require iis/library
```

## Usage

The helper functions are autoloaded with composer so you can use them without any additional setup. Read the [documentation](docs/api.md) to get started.

## Contribution

Make sure you add tests for all helpers and also that you lint the code to make sure that it follows the [IIS Coding Conventions](https://github.com/sewebb/iis-start/wiki/IIS-standards-&-conventions#wordpressphp)
